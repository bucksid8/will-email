Next I want you to include a step by step method that outlines how you were able to solve your struggles by creating a 3 part workflow for content creation. End with outlining the importance of having a streamlined workflow if you are serious about growing your instagram following.", "completion": "Not many people know this about me.\nWhen I first started posting content on Instagram, I published over 100 videos before I hit 500 followers.\nThat is 100 days of filming, editing, and ideating just to hit 500 followers.\nAnd people give up after not hitting 100k followers after one week…\nThe reason I bring this up is simple. This shit is hard. As easy as it may look to grow an audience online, this takes time. Sure some people will post one video that goes mega-viral and gain 50k followers overnight but those people are black swans among black swans. And even those people probably spent years trying and failing just to get to that point.\nSo do not expect this to be different for you. Go into this assuming that it will take a long time.\nNow once you understand this you need a game plan to stay consistent and to even be able to do this for a long time. The method to do this most effectively is to create workflows and systems for creating content. Here are my favorites.\nContent Pipeline\nTo be a high-output creator you need to be organized. You can never start a video with a blank piece of paper. You should always have a starting point/ Having a content pipeline gives you a place to dump ideas, write scripts and organize published content. This was a game changer for me.\nIdea Organizer\nThere a million ways to do this but my preferred method is my ScribeCards Notion template (you can grab it free here: _____). This is where I dump any thought or inspiration I have. Whether it be a podcast, quote, or article. Anything that inspires me gets written down and put here to be used when I ideate and script for videos.\nTask-Blocking\nThis system is so important when it comes to being a full-time or part-time creative. There is a lot that goes into this and it is hard to manage all the small little things that are easy to forget and push off. Having a strong system in place to track and finish tasks is going to save you from hours of stress and late-night work sessions.\nAt the end of the day the best system is the system that works best for you. Try and test different workflows and methods to see what makes this the easiest and most seamless process for you."}

Every thing I have worked for in the last 4 years, gone.\n“What the hell am I supposed to do now?”\n…\nThis is obviously not a true story (at least not yet). But if it were real, what would I do? If my account was deleted and I had to start from square one, what would be the first thing I did?\nAfter everything I have learned from building my personal brand the first thing I would do is this:\nStart again.\n”Wow, no shit Will.”\nIt might sound insulting to call that advice, but trying again after failing is a skill most do not have. And if you don’t believe me, answer me this: Why do 99% of creators fail? Do they fail because they never give up? Because they conquer adversity? Because they crave discomfort and growth?\nNo. They fail because they do the complete opposite.\nThe core reason for my success in the last year is that I simply never gave up. Every previous attempt at a business or venture in my life has failed because I gave up when shit got hard. I think I owe this resilience to Stoicism. It taught to take the punches but not let it effect me. That is what you need.\nCreate a fucking chiseled mind. When your worst nightmares come true, rather than scurry off with your tail between your legs, look at it, nod your head, and say “Okay… this will be hard, this will be difficult, but it is just another challenge for me to overcome and grow from”.\nTake that mindset and apply what you have already learned from the past and you will be invincible. The social media and content creation tips and tricks are great but none of it matters without a foundation in mental resilience.\nImagine yourself to be a character in a video game. When you meet a new boss and die, you don’t just turn off the console (or PC… sorry) and give up. You yell “fuck me!” at the TV screen, collect your emotions, Google a better way to do it, and try again.\nSound familiar? That is because that is literally life. When you try something and realize you are bad at it, what do you do next? You search for answers.\nLook at the trials you face the same way. They are there to show you what you don’t yet know and provide and opportunity to learn."}

But past the surface of my goals, there was not much. I had ambition but there was still something I was missing.\nWhen we are young and first experience the world as an adult, we feel like we made it to ‘the end’. High school and adolescence were the journey and being an adult was the reward. Or at least that is what we think.\nBut actually, that could not be further from the truth.\nWhen I dropped out, I was convinced I already possessed all the knowledge needed to succeed. I had a camera I was good with and everyone I knew would agree. What else do I need?\nHow naive.\nFrom a technical standpoint, that is flat-out stupidity. The fact I really believed I could find the success I dreamed of because I knew how to properly expose a camera is ludicrous. But that was not the problem.\nThe problem was that I stopped being a student. I chose to believe that I had learned enough. The problem with this belief is that we can never “learn enough”.\nThere is no tipping point for intelligence. And when it comes to business; knowledge and action will take you pretty damn far. So I failed miserably. I went 5 years with almost no growth. I hardly made any progress toward any of my goals.\nMy income stayed the same.\nMy skills stayed the same.\nMy overall contentment with life stayed the same.\nI was completely stuck.\nBeing stuck in a belief that you have everything you need to succeed, but still not finding success, is insanely frustrating and confusing. If you are a creative entrepreneur, I am sure you have experienced this (or you are experiencing it now).\nBut eventually, I made my way out.\nOver time I came to realize I was far from the end.\nThrough this admittance of ignorance, we are able to move to the next level of thought. This allows us to learn and grow. Which is something most of us need to do.\nI am not sure why many of us believe we have it figured out when we do not. It could be that we are scared to hurt our own egos. I know for me this was probably the case. Creatives tend to steer away from things that show our flaws and deficiencies. But that is a necessary conversation to have, especially if you are trying to build a business.\nThe most effective way to understand your lack of readiness is to experience something new. This could be a new business venture or maybe a different genre of literature. The point is to be exposed to new thoughts and ideas.\nWhen we do this we allow ourselves to see that we do not possess everything we need to take that next step toward our big goal.\nThis moment in time will be the great turning point of your life.\nThe moment we realize there is more to learn our potential output explodes.\nIn 6 months you can go from completely lost to having a vivid vision of your future with little doubt that you will not accomplish it. It is not easy of course but is very doable. And learning to be disciplined will be the number one catalyst.\nDiscipline will be your superpower. Ensuring that you are a constant student of your craft will move you forward in ways you never imagined. If you are always exploring you are always growing. And growth is necessary if you plan to reach a point beyond where you are now. Being disciplined, however, is easier said than done.\nIt takes time to develop this skill. Constant iteration and constant practice on your mindset. But luckily, that is all it takes.\nThe lesson here is to stay aware of your actions and ego. Constantly evaluate yourself and ask yourself if you are still learning. When we do find success, it is easy to fall back into that hole of believing we have learned it all.\nSometimes your biggest roadblock is yourself, stopping yourself from learning and growing."}

One day we are at our peak, the climax of our being. Just to be reminded the next moment that we are nothing, which sucks all motivation out of us.\nI am sure you have experienced this for yourself.\nYou received the promotion and feel empty.\nYou won the race but feel lost.\nYou hit 10,000 followers but it feels pointless.\nThis is not unique to certain individuals who carry lazy and lethargic personalities. This happens to most people, at least those who lack the tools necessary to avoid it.\nBefore we can explore how to avoid these moments of despair, we first need to understand why they happen.\nCreative ruts, and any rut for that matter, occur when we lack clarity on our path toward the future. In simple terms, it is when we know what we want, but do not know how to get there.\nThe first major rut I can remember started in the spring of 2018. It was my sophomore year in college. I was studying digital media production but deep down I knew the degree was a backup plan.\nMy real goal was to own a video production company. I was obsessed with filmmaking and photography. Anything with a camera\nSo what did I do?\nI dropped out of course.\nLike any logical 19-year-old would do.\nThat is when the rut started and lasted for about 3 years (a long time I know). I had no idea what I was doing. I thought I knew my goal (I didn't) and I thought I would know how to get there (I didn't).\nThat is the point most people are at in their lives. The reality is, that the brief ruts you think you are in now are actually smaller pieces to a bigger puzzle. I am not talking about week-long feelings of confusion and despair.\nI am talking about years of dissatisfaction and misguidance that lead to depression and an obsession with self-worth.\nBeing able to consistently navigate this roadblock will unlock a life that you did not think was possible.\nImagine a life where you never fell off your horse, where you were in constant pursuit of your goal. Where the days were filled with focus and clarity rather than confusion and disgust.\nThat is what we are creating. We are creating clarity on the future so that your mind will never wander into the gaping hole that is ignorance.\nThe first step is to find your purpose. That is heavy I know. I don't expect any of you to be able to fully grasp what this means for yourself.\nThis takes time and hours of self-reflection to master, but that is not what we need to do here. To start, we only need a direction, not a turn-by-turn GPS system.\nYour purpose will be some combination of; what you are good at it, what you can be paid for, what you enjoy, and what the world needs.\nAgain, we are getting deep here so do not overwhelm yourself.\nChoose a direction you want to head and stick to it.\nMaybe it is educating others on the tools they need to create the life of their dream.\nOr winning Mr. Olympia.\nOr creating an AI that will automate food distribution and production (I don't know).\nNext, you need to seek out challenges. In his book Flow, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi states that in order to enter a state of flow we must be challenged. If something is too easy, we will become mindless. If it is too hard, we will lose interest.\nThe reason I reference this book is because oftentimes ruts sprout from a lifestyle of mindlessness. Doing the same thing, day in and day out. Never reaching for more.\nChallenges are the Pokemon trainers we battle on the path to the Elite Four (you're welcome to my Pokemon nerds). They are obstacles that level us up and unlock new skills. Sometimes they allow us entry to new places we have not been before.\nChase these trainers down. Don't just mindlessly run into them either. Seek them out with intention and remain aware of what you are receiving from them.\nThe last step of this process is something done internally.\nYou must redefine your definition of success.\nIf you currently define success as the outcome of your actions you have created a recipe for anguish and unhappiness.\nSuccess needs to be determined only by your output and how you improve upon it.\nWhat does this mean?\nIt means to control what you can control and be conscious of its production.\nIf we rely only on the fruit of our labor for a sense of accomplishment, and not the labor, we are giving up control of our emotions and mental well-being to the universe.\nAnd the universe does not give a fuck about you (sorry).\nFrame your mind to acknowledge your level of success by the work you put in. The caveat is that the work must be directed and focused on your purpose. If it is not, you will fall into that gaping hole of ignorance we discussed before.\nConstantly review your actions and reiterate what is working. If something does not fuel your purpose, ditch it. Otherwise, it becomes a distraction that once again leads to mindlessness which in turn leads to a rut.\nIf you can wake up every day, take real action within your purpose, seek discomfort through challenges, and acknowledge your efforts, you will never fall into another rut.\nI want to put this in the simplest of terms for you so you can fully grasp what I am saying.\nA rut will occur when you lack the understanding of what you need to do to accomplish your goal.\nWe can avoid this by clearly defining our life purpose, seeking challenges that improve ourselves, and focusing solely on the real work that we can control rather than the outcomes it provides.\nSo what happened to that 19-year-old dropout who wanted to be a filmmaker so badly?\nWell, he chose to focus on one thing. He understood that his sole mission was to enable others to unlock the understanding he now had. He strove (and still strives) to be better every day and seek new challenges.\nAnd lastly, he put in the real work every day and enjoyed the journey rather than daydreaming about the outcome.\nStay present. Focus on the real work."}

I looked successful on the outside because I believed that was how the game worked.\nFake it ‘til you make it.\nBut that is an illusion and if you follow that path you will meet the same fate as me. Call it arrogance, call it ignorance. At the end of the day, it was a fragile ego.\nMy entire life up until this point was all about proving others wrong. I believe most creatives have a similar backstory. We hated school and did poorly, but had massive dreams and knew were destined for more.\nDo not get me wrong, that is a great thing. Having the ambition and desire for more is beautiful. But there is a step beyond that desire that is equally important.\nReal work.\nThat is what 19-year-old me lacked.\nAction and focus.\nI think the reason most creative entrepreneurs fall short at this point is that it is a rare situation.

Just because something only requires skill does not mean it is not impressive. What I am saying, is the path of a creative entrepreneur is rare and most are not prepared for it.\nWe can be skilled video editors but without sales, we will never land clients.\nWe can be incredible writers but without networking, we will never be published.\nThis is where most give up. This is the point in the race the photographer decides they will make it a hobby and get a “real job”.

If you have a creative skill that does not also mean you must own a business. Not all creatives are made for it. But I do believe we can all learn how to.\nOwning a business is the ultimate form of creative expression. A business is taking your creativity and sharing it with as many people as possible, to make a living.\nIt is an equation made in the heavens.\nUnderstanding this is essential.\nThe biggest struggle as a new creative entrepreneur is pricing. We have no idea what we are worth. This leads to losing clients, sporadic income, stunted growth, etc.\nMost of the time this happens because we are unaware of how valuable we really our. We are so conditioned to our skill (or skillset) that it seems crazy that other people would pay us (and pay us a lot) for it.\nBut we are valuable. Highly valuable. Combine that with the understanding that you are a business and not a freelancer and you will be on the right path.\nI am rambling a bit here, but it is because I want you to totally flip your current belief as to why you are stuck right now.\nIt is not because you lack valuable skills.\nThe reason you are failing and stuck in your current position is because you lack focus and intention which is a symptom of your ego.\nWhen you are a college dropout who tells everyone you run a business (that is making no money), it is hard to admit you are confused and lost.\nBut the moment you do and swallow your pride is the moment you will begin to find success and growth.\nWe can’t fix a problem if we don’t even look it in the eye and admit it is there.\nThat is where the story begins.

You cannot give yourself a clear plan of action without a clear goal and you cannot achieve your goal without a clear plan of action.

It could be 1 or 5 or 15- that is up to you.\nOnce you have done that, cross out all but 3. The big 3 need to be the highest priority. Your biggest motivators.\nThe reality is that you can do anything but not everything. You have to have temporary sacrifice here. This does not mean you are neglecting these forever, it means that they are not a number 1, 2, or 3 priority.\nNow that you know what your big goals are, you can give yourself actionable steps to do so.

And when you realize that the rest is easy."}
{"prompt": "Write an email about your 2024 content strategy, which is to create content based on anything that interests you or inspires you. Explain that the key to being a successful content creator and building a personal brand is to be authentic and unique. Mention how the internet is crowded with content creators offering generic advice, but you believe in showcasing your personality and interests to create a deeper connection with your audience. Warn about the risks of relying on trends and how quickly audiences can lose interest when those trends fade. Encourage readers to focus on being themselves and integrating their personal stories and interests into their content. Emphasize that the \"personal\" in personal branding is crucial and often forgotten, and that by letting people into your life, you turn them into community members, not just followers.", "completion": "Email 9:\nMy content strategy for 2024 is simple- and please steal this for yourself.\nI am going to make whatever it is that I want to make.\nAnything that interests me.\nAnything the catches my eyes.\nAnything that inspires me.\nI am going to make something with it, and I encourage you too as well. And this is why.\nThe whole point of being a content creator and building a personal brand is to quite literally, be yourself. Because that is something entirely unique to you. That is value that no one else can provide.\nThe internet is flooded with content creators telling you how to “make $10k/month using AI and following these 5 steps”.\nFucking awful man.\nWhat is the point in that? What sort of trust and audience are you building? Creators like that will fizzle out faster than they came onto to the scene. That is because there is no substance. Nothing for the followers to latch onto.\nNot only that, what happens when the trend they are talking about dies out and their entire audience only followed them for that specific theme of content? What do you now? If you pivot and talk about something new, you know have 100,000 people that don’t care and won’t engage.\nDoes this scare you? Because it should.\nBut alas do no fret my friend because you already have the solution.\nBe your god damn self.\nObviously have pillar themes to your content and don’t stray too far from your brand, but show some personality. Be yourself. Talk about how running changed your life and how music inspires you to create. Be the college dropout turned music producing, triathlon athlete.\nBe broad by being specific. Let people into your life and they will become a community member not a follower.\nThat is how you build a real personal brand. “Personal” is the most important part but also the most forgotten.\n"}
{"prompt": "Write an email about how you created and posted lots of content last year, every single day, without being overwhelmed or overworked. Briefly mention that you did all the filming, editing, and writing yourself, and still managed to take vacations. Outline the key methods that helped you: - Systems: Stress the importance of having organized systems in place for efficient content creation. - Clarity and Focus: Highlight how having clear goals kept you motivated and focused. - Balance: Discuss the need for a balance between work and leisure, criticizing the extreme hustle culture. Conclude by emphasizing the importance of finding a healthy balance to avoid burnout while being productive in content creation.", "completion": "Email 10:\nLast year I created literally hundreds of pieces of content and did not miss a single day of posting.\nYou may think that sounds overwhelming and impossible. It would be easy to assume that I also worked a lot and was miserable. How else could I have created 365 reels alone?\n(and before you say “oh but Will you probably have a whole team of editors and writers….”. Nope. This is all me. I filmed the video, editing the video, and I am writing this email.)\nBut I worked a normal amount and I was not miserable. I even went on a few long vacations and took plenty of time off on holidays (maybe too much).\nSo, how have I done this? Well it comes down to a few main reasons. The first being the biggest.\nMethod One: Systems, systems, systems\nThis is a hill I will die on. If you don’t have systems you will not last on social media. This is a consistency game and in order to be consistent you have to a plan. Making content takes a lot of time. That can be very draining especially if you work a 9-5 or other job outside of this. There is no room for willy-nilly activities. We have limited time and need to capitalize on it.\nI have done this through developing a content pipeline and thought organizer, time/task-blocking my week, creating editing workflows and presets, and developing brand guidelines. If that sounds like a lot, it is because it is. There is a lot of overhead effort that goes into developing systems but the ROI (return on investment) is infinite.\nMethod Two: Clarity and Focus\nThe biggest game changer when it came to my motivation and drive on a daily basis was creating calrity on my goals and purpose. Listen, focus and energy are both finite resources and they cannot be wasted on pointless activities that are not moving you toward your goals. Whether it is the newest and best side-hustle of 2024 or starting a newsletter you can’t handle… learn to say no.\nDiscover your “big why” (your one thing) and focus solely on that and nothing else.\nMethod Three: Balance\nI fucking hate hustle culture. I don’t understand it. Why is cool to abandon your friends and family? In what world is it only possible to succeed by not enjoying life? What is the point of making a fuck ton of money and creating a life you love, if you can’t even enjoy for yourself or with others? Sounds really lame to me.\nSo create balance in your life.\nFocus when you need to focus and understand there is sacrifice\nBut also play the video game on Saturday afternoon. Go to the cocktail bar on Friday night with your lady. Buy your dream car and love it death.\nJust find your balance. The last thing you want to do is begin to spite this and burnout.\nThen it was all for nothing.\n"}
